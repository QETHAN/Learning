In Mac OS X, you can set the environment variables in one of the following files :

~/.bashrc
~/.bash_profile
~/.profile
By default, Mac OS X does not has above files, you need to create it manually.

$PATH example
This example shows you how to set “mongodb/bin” folder to the existing $PATH environment variable.

$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
 
 
$cd ~
$pwd
/Users/QETHAN
$touch .bash_profile
$vim .bash_profile
 
export NODE_DEV=development
 
##restart your terminal
$ echo $NODE_DEV

Done.
